# codesignal_challenges 
üêç Python solved challanges form https://app.codesignal.com/ with multiple solutions and additional comments.

[CodeSignal.com](https://codesignal.com/) is an algorithm testing site to help learn a new language or prepare for a technical interview. It has various modes including solving algorithms, interview practice, timed challenges, company bots, and tournaments.

## How Does CodeSignal Work?
- In each algorithm you are given a description to solve.
- Tests given some public tests to view which means you can see the input and desired output. Hidden tests which can not be viewed are also given and will need to be solved. You have the ability to write your own tests for specific cases or to try and guess the hidden cases. 
- Gold is provided for solving challenges which can be used to help solve algorithms. If you are able to save a large amount of gold you may buy a t-shirt with it as well.
