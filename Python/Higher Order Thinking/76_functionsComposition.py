'''
As a professional and respected database programmer, you implemented a low-level API for your front-end colleagues to use. One of them, however, appeared to be quite an ungrateful exemplar, and had the nerve to criticize your work: it seems to him that the functionality your API provides is too basic, and he has to implement several additional functions on his end to make things work.

You don't like to leave the users of your ingenious work disgruntled, so you have to update your API. It can be done quite simple: most of the high-level functionality can be added by combining several basic functions. Now you need to implement a function that will compose an arbitrary number of functions, and test it on some variable x.

Example

For functions = ["abs", "math.sin", "lambda x: 3 * x / 2"]
and x = 3.1415, the output should be
functionsComposition(functions, x) = 1.

abs(math.sin(3 * 3.1415 / 2)) = abs(sin(4.71225)) â‰ˆ abs(-1) = 1.

from functools import reduce
def compose(functions):
    return reduce(lambda f,g : lambda x: f(g(x)), functions)
    # return functions[0] if len(functions) == 1 else compose([lambda x: functions[0](functions[1](x))] + functions[2:])

def functionsComposition(functions, x):
    return compose(map(eval, functions))(x)
