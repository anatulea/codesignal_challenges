Consider two straight lines given as y = mx + b. You forgot what they mean but you're sure that the destiny of the universe depends on them. To save the world, you have to choose one of these lines. Here is how to make the proper choice:

Consider all integer coordinates a for all possible values of a from l to r, inclusive.
For each vertical x = a, find the points where this vertical intersects with line1 and line2. Denote these points as p1 and p2, respectively. If p1 and p2 don't coincide, give one point to the line which is higher in that vertical.
Choose the line which has a larger score. Return "first" for line1, "second" for line2 and "any" if both lines have the same score.
Example

For line1 = [1, 2], line2 = [2, 1], l = 0, and r = 2, the output should be
twoLines(line1, line2, l, r) = "any";
For line1 = [1, 2], line2 = [2, 1], l = -1, and r = 2, the output should be
twoLines(line1, line2, l, r) = "first";
For line1 = [1, 2], line2 = [2, 1], l = 0, and r = 3, the output should be
twoLines(line1, line2, l, r) = "second".

        y2 = line2_y(x)

            balance += 1

            balance -= 1

        return "first"

        return "second"

    Partial functions allow us to fix a certain number of arguments of a function and generate a new function.
    Partial functions can be used to derive specialized functions from general functions and therefore help us to reuse our code
